## Comments on chapters

### Evolutionary origins of plasticity

- It really shows that this chapter is my first publication. A little clunky.
- I definitely did *not* yet know how to manage experiment code, data, and analyses well. 

## Thoughts

- Process is a nostagia trip. Old papers are simultaneously much better and much worse than I remember ;)
