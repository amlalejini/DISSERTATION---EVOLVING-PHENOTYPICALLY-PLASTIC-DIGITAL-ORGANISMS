# Construction notes

## Title ideas

- Evolving Responsive digital organisms
- Evolving phenotypically plastic digital organisms
- Evolving phenotypically plastic computer programs

## Reminders/Todos:

- [ ] Double check degree names for CS and EEB
- [ ] Double check general formatting requirements
- [ ] Make capitalization consistent (check to see if others did this)
- [ ] Print/read Introduction
- [ ] Print/read Conclusion
- [x] Fix copyright page formatting
- [x] Name figures

### Editing/writing

#### Origins of Plasticity

- [ ] Editing pass over origins of plasticity chapter
- [ ] Optimize lineage figure placement (High mut and baseline can be next to each other?)
- [ ] Correct grammar for 'point-mutation rate' vs 'point mutation rate'?

#### SignalGP

- [ ] Editing pass over chapter
- [ ] Tweak p value reporting
- [ ] Update figure legends
- [ ] Update election figure legend w/abbreviations for conditions

#### Tag-based regulation

- [ ] Update with final version of the paper
- [ ] Update chapter title if necessary
- [ ] Update main chapter citation (create from scratch if necessary)
- [ ] Fix boolean logic calculator network figure => currently too large for this format
  - Break into two figures?

## Questions:

- How to indicate what chapter was adapted from?
  - Authors: .... [citation].
  - Authors: ... \newline Chapter adapted from [citation].
  - This chapter is adapted from a paper that appeared in ... [citation].
- How much effort should I put into editing old publications (e.g., origins of plasticity chapter)?

## Nomenclature and convention

### Chapter IDs

- Introduction: `introduction`
- Evolutionary origins of phenotypic plasticity: `origins-of-plasticity`
- Evolutionary consequences of phenotypic plasticity: `consequences-of-plasticity`
- Evolving event-driven programs with SignalGP: `signalgp`
- Tag-based genetic regulation: `tag-based-regulation`
- Tag-accessed memory for genetic programming: `tag-accessed-memory`
- Conclusion: `conclusion`

### Labeling

- Chapter: `chapter:[chapter id]`
- Section: `chapter:[chapter id]:sec:[section path]`
- Figures: `chapter:[chapter id]:fig:[figure name]`
- Tables: `chapter:[chapter id]:table:[table name]`
- Equation: `chapter:[chapter id]:equ:[equation name]`

## Future work

### Evolutionary origins of plasticity

- Expand on every front: 
    - Change rate: More change rates. Stochastic changes. More complex environments. 
    - Mutation rate: mutation rate vs. change rate => relaxed selection?
    - Stepping stones: identify specific mutations that were critical along lineages
- Look at task plasticity vs. flow/execution plasticity

## Comments on chapters

### Evolutionary origins of plasticity

- It really shows that Chapter one is my first publication. A little clunky. Buries the lead. Etc.
- Do not love the organization of this paper!
- Did *not* yet know how to manage experiment code, data, and analyses well. 

## Thoughts

- Process is a nostagia trip. Old papers are simultaneously much better and much worse than I remember ;)

### Acknowledgements

- First person in family to navigate graduate school. Bumbled my way through. Would not even known how to bumble without my academic mentors along the way. I still don't know how to bumble the rest of the way, but I know I have a wealth of mentors to help.
