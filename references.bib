	abstract = {Abstract Natural selection can adjust the rate of mutation in a population by acting on allelic variation affecting processes of DNA replication and repair. Because mutation is the ultimate source of the genetic variation required for adaptation, it can be appealing to suppose that the genomic mutation rate is adjusted to a level that best promotes adaptation. Most mutations with phenotypic effects are harmful, however, and thus there is relentless selection within populations for lower genomic mutation rates. Selection on beneficial mutations can counter this effect by favoring alleles that raise the mutation rate, but the effect of beneficial mutations on the genomic mutation rate is extremely sensitive to recombination and is unlikely to be important in sexual populations. In contrast, high genomic mutation rates can evolve in asexual populations under the influence of beneficial mutations, but this phenomenon is probably of limited adaptive significance and represents, at best, a temporary reprieve from the continual selection pressure to reduce mutation. The physiological cost of reducing mutation below the low level observed in most populations may be the most important factor in setting the genomic mutation rate in sexual and asexual systems, regardless of the benefits of mutation in producing new adaptive variation. Maintenance of mutation rates higher than the minimum set by this “cost of fidelity” is likely only under special circumstances. BioEssays 22:1057–1066, 2000. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

They differ from conventional ANNs in many aspects, but the key difference is that instead of a layered architecture, with each node performing the same function, Markov Brains are networks built from individual computational components. These computational components interact with each other, receive inputs from sensors, and control motor outputs. The function of the computational components, their connections to each other, as well as connections to sensors and motors are all subject to evolutionary optimization. Here we describe in detail how a Markov Brain works, what techniques can be used to study them, and how they can be evolved.},

	abstract = {The emergence of new replicating entities from the union of simpler entities characterizes some of the most profound events in natural evolutionary history. Such transitions in individuality are essential to the evolution of the most complex forms of life. Thus, understanding these transitions is critical to building artificial systems capable of open-ended evolution. Alas, these transitions are challenging to induce or detect, even with computational organisms. Here, we introduce the DISHTINY (Distributed Hierarchical Transitions in Individuality) platform, which provides simple cell-like organisms with the ability and incentive to unite into new individuals in a manner that can continue to scale to subsequent transitions. The system is designed to encourage these transitions so that they can be studied: Organisms that coordinate spatiotemporally can maximize the rate of resource harvest, which is closely linked to their reproductive ability. We demonstrate the hierarchical emergence of multiple levels of individuality among simple cell-like organisms that evolve parameters for manually designed strategies. During evolution, we observe reproductive division of labor and close cooperation among cells, including resource-sharing, aggregation of resource endowments for propagules, and emergence of an apoptosis response to somatic mutation. Many replicate populations evolved to direct their resources toward low-level groups (behaving like multicellular individuals), and many others evolved to direct their resources toward high-level groups (acting as larger-scale multicellular individuals).},

	abstract = {Epigenetic modifications to DNA, such as DNA methylation, can expand a genome’s regulatory flexibility, and thus may contribute to the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. Recent work has demonstrated the importance of DNA methylation in alternative queen and worker “castes” in social insects, particularly honeybees. Social insects are an excellent system for addressing questions about epigenetics and evolution because: (1) they have dramatic caste polyphenisms that appear to be tied to differential methylation, (2) DNA methylation is widespread in various groups of social insects, and (3) there are intriguing connections between the social environment and DNA methylation in many species, from insects to mammals. In this article, we review research on honeybees, and, when available, other social insects, on DNA methylation and queen and worker caste differences. We outline a conceptual framework for the effects of methylation on caste determination in honeybees that may help guide studies of epigenetic regulation in other polyphenic taxa. Finally, we suggest future paths of study for social insect epigenetic research, including the importance of comparative studies of DNA methylation on a broader range of species, and highlight some key unanswered mechanistic questions about how DNA methylation affects gene regulation.},

	abstract = {Transcriptomic studies have demonstrated that the vast majority of the genomes of mammals and other complex organisms is expressed in highly dynamic and cell-specific patterns to produce large numbers of intergenic, antisense and intronic long non-protein-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Despite well characterized examples, their scaling with developmental complexity, and many demonstrations of their association with cellular processes, development and diseases, lncRNAs are still to be widely accepted as major players in gene regulation. This may reflect an underappreciation of the extent and precision of the epigenetic control of differentiation and development, where lncRNAs appear to have a central role, likely as organizational and guide molecules: most lncRNAs are nuclear-localized and chromatin-associated, with some involved in the formation of specialized subcellular domains. I suggest that a reassessment of the conceptual framework of genetic information and gene expression in the 4-dimensional ontogeny of spatially organized multicellular organisms is required. Together with this and further studies on their biology, the key challenges now are to determine the structure–function relationships of lncRNAs, which may be aided by emerging evidence of their modular structure, the role of RNA editing and modification in enabling epigenetic plasticity, and the role of RNA signaling in transgenerational inheritance of experience.},

	abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired ‘inference at a glance’ nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These “raincloud plots” can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab (

Moreover, in spite of some performance improvements, it is a fact that biological knowledge has advanced faster than our ability to incorporate novel biological ideas into EAs. Recently, some researchers have started exploring computationally new comprehension of the multitude of the regulatory mechanisms that are fundamental in both processes of inheritance and of development in natural systems, by trying to include those mechanisms in the EAs. One of the first successful proposals was the Artificial Gene Regulatory Network (ARN) model, by Wolfgang Banzhaf. Soon after some variants of the ARN were tested. In this paper, we describe one of those, the Regulatory Network Computational Device, demonstrating experimentally its capabilities. The efficacy and efficiency of this alternative is tested experimentally using typical benchmark problems for Genetic Programming (GP) systems. We devise a modified factorial problem to investigate the use of feedback connections and the scalability of the approach. In order to gain a better understanding about the reasons for the improved quality of the results, we undertake a preliminary study about the role of neutral mutations during the evolutionary process.},

The system also has a notion of local computational resources. We see different evolutionary paths depending on the specified parameters and the level of complexity, measured as distance from initially randomized core. For several initial conditions the system is able to develop extremely viable cooperative structures (organisms?) which totally dominate the core.

	abstract = {Many argue that to evolve artificial intelligence that rivals that of natural animals, we need to evolve neural networks that are structurally organized in that they exhibit modularity, regularity, and hierarchy. It was recently shown that a cost for network connections, which encourages the evolution of modularity, can be combined with an indirect encoding, which encourages the evolution of regularity, to evolve networks that are both modular and regular. However, the bias towards regularity from indirect encodings may prevent evolution from independently optimizing different modules to perform different functions, unless modularity in the phenotype is aligned with modularity in the genotype. We test this hypothesis on two multi-modal problems—a pattern recognition task and a robotics task—that each require different phenotypic modules. In general, we find that performance is improved only when genotypic and phenotypic modularity are encouraged simultaneously, though the role of alignment remains unclear. In addition, intuitive manual decompositions fail to provide the performance benefits of automatic methods on the more challenging robotics problem, emphasizing the importance of automatic, rather than manual, decomposition methods. These results suggest encouraging modularity in both the genotype and phenotype as an important step towards solving large-scale multi-modal problems, but also indicate that more research is required before we can evolve structurally organized networks to solve tasks that require multiple, different neural modules.},

At the level of programs, System F provides higher-order programming capabilities with functions and types as first-class objects, e.g., functions can take other functions and types as parameters. At the level of types, System F provides parametric polymorphism. The expressiveness of the system provides the potential for a genetic programming system to evolve looping, recursion, lists, trees and many other typical programming structures and behaviour. This is done without introducing additional external symbols in the set of predefined functions and terminals of the system. In fact, we actually remove programming structures such as if/then/else, which we replace by two abstraction operators. We also change the composition of parse trees so that they may directly include types.},

	abstract = {Existing approaches to artificial intelligence problems such as sequence induction, automatic programming, machine learning, planning, and pattern recognition typically require specification in advance of the size and shape of the solution to the problem (often in a unnatural and difficult way). This paper reports on a new approach in which the size and shape of the solution to such problems is dynamically created using Darwinian principles of reproduction and survival of the fittest. Moreover, the resulting solution is inherently hierarchical. The paper describes computer experiments, using the author's 4341 line LISP program, in five areas of artificial intelligence, namely (1) sequence induction (e.g. inducing a computational procedure for the recursive Fibonacci sequence and inducing a computational procedure for a cubic polynomial sequence), (2) automatic programming (e.g. discovering a computational procedure for solving pairs of linear equations, solving quadratic equations for complex roots, and discovering trigonometric identities), (3) machine learning of functions (e.g. learning a Boolean multiplexer function previously studied in neural net and classifier system work and learning the exclusive-or and parity function), (4) planning (e.g. developing a robotic action sequence that can stack an arbitrary initial configuration of blocks into a specified order), and (5) pattern recognition (e.g. translation-invariant recognition of a simple one dimensional shape in a linear retina).},

	abstract = {We present a study in the evolution of temporal behavior, specifically synchronization and desynchronization, through digital evolution and group selection. In digital evolution, a population of self-replicating computer programs exists in a user-defined computational environment and is subject to instruction-level mutations and natural selection. Group selection links the survival of the individual to the survival of its group, thus encouraging cooperation. Previous approaches to engineering synchronization and desynchronization algorithms have taken inspiration from nature: In the well-known firefly model, the only form of communication between agents is in the form of flash messages among neighbors. Here we demonstrate that populations of digital organisms, provided with a similar mechanism and minimal information about their environment, are capable of evolving algorithms for synchronization and desynchronization, and that the evolved behaviors are robust to message loss. We further describe how the evolved behavior for synchronization mimics that of the well-known Ermentrout model for firefly synchronization in biology. In addition to discovering self-organizing behaviors for distributed computing systems, this result indicates that digital evolution may be used to further our understanding of synchronization in biology.},

	abstract = {Predator-prey coevolution is commonly thought to result in reciprocal arms races that produce increasingly extreme and complex traits. However, such directional change is not inevitable. Here, we provide evidence for a previously undemonstrated dynamic that we call "strategy chases," wherein populations explore strategies with similar levels of complexity, but differing behaviorally. Indeed, in populations of evolving digital organisms, as prey evolved more effective predator-avoidance strategies, they explored a wider range of behavioral strategies in addition to exhibiting increased levels of behavioral complexity. Furthermore, coevolved prey became more adept in foraging, evidently through coopting components of explored sense-and-flee avoidance strategies into sense-and-retrieve foraging strategies. Specifically, we demonstrate that coevolution induced non-escalating exploration of behavioral space, corresponding with significant evolutionary advancements, including increasingly intelligent behavioral strategies.},

	doi = {10.1162/artl_a_00066},
	abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) is a collective behavior whereby actions of individuals depend on the density of the surrounding population. Bacteria use QS to trigger secretion of digestive enzymes, formation and destruction of biofilms, and, in the case of pathogenic organisms, expression of virulence factors that cause disease. Investigations of mechanisms that prevent or disrupt QS, referred to as quorum quenching, are of interest because they provide a new alternative to antibiotics for treating bacterial infections. Traditional antibiotics either kill bacteria or inhibit their growth, producing selective pressures that promote resistant strains. In contrast, quorum quenching and other so-called anti-infective strategies focus on altering behavior. In this article we evolve QS in populations of digital organisms, a type of self-replicating computer program, and investigate the effects of quorum quenching on these populations. Specifically, we injected the populations with mutant organisms that were impaired in selected ways to disrupt the QS process. The experimental results indicate that the rate at which these mutants are introduced into a population influences both the evolvability of QS and the persistence of an existing QS behavior. Surprisingly, we also observed resistance to quorum quenching. Effectively, populations evolved resistance by reaching quorum at lower cell densities than did the parent strain. Moreover, the level of resistance was highest when the rate of mutant introduction increased over time. These results show that digital organisms can serve as a model to study the evolution and disruption of QS, potentially informing wet-lab studies aimed at identifying targets for anti-infective development.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Spatial heterogeneity is believed to be an evolutionary driver of biodiversity. Variability in the distribution of resource patches can allow an environment to support a wider variety of phenotypes for selection to act upon at the ecosystem level, which may lead to more species. However, the generality of this principle has not been thoroughly tested, as the relevant adaptive dynamics occur on evolutionary timescales. We overcame this challenge by performing experiments on populations of digital organisms in the Avida Digital Evolution Platform, in which we investigated the impact of spatial resource heterogeneity on phenotypic diversity. Since an important benefit of diversity may be increased evolutionary potential, we also tracked the probability of a complex trait evolving in the context of various levels of spatial heterogeneity. We found that spatial entropy and phenotypic diversity have a strong positive correlation and this relationship is consistent across various spatial configurations. Diversity also increases evolutionary potential, but has a much smaller impact than other components of environmental composition. The most important of these components was the mean number of resources present in locations across the environment, likely owing to the importance of building blocks for the evolution of complex features. These results suggest that a general relationship exists between spatial heterogeneity and diversity, beyond the specific ecosystems and timescales in which it has previously been studied. By examining this relationship in the context of phenotypic evolution, we advance a mechanistic understanding of the resulting dynamics. Moreover, our results suggest that the likelihood of evolving various traits can be impacted by the spatial configuration of patches in which these traits are advantageous. These findings have implications for both evolutionary biology and evolutionary computation, as generating and maintaining diversity is critical to all forms of evolution.},

However, the difficulty of working with natural ecosystems has meant that this theory has rarely been tested. Here, we use the Avida experimental platform to demonstrate the evolution of ecosystems composed of digital organisms. We show that stable ecosystems are formed during evolution in an environment where organisms must compete for limiting resources. Stable coexistence was not observed in environments where resource levels were not limiting, suggesting that competition for resources was responsible for coexistence. To test this, we restarted populations evolved in the resource-limited environment but increased resource levels to be non-limiting. In this environment, ecosystems previously supporting multiple genotypes could maintain only a single genotype. These results demonstrate the utility of the Avida platform for addressing ecological questions and demonstrate its potential in addressing questions involving ecosystem-level processes.},

Theory suggests that modularity promotes evolvability, and that aggravating (synergistic) epistasis among deleterious mutations facilitates the evolution of sex. Here, by contrast, we investigate the evolution of different genetic architectures using digital organisms, which are computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, compete and evolve. Specifically, we investigate how genetic architecture is shaped by reproductive mode. We allowed 200 populations of digital organisms to evolve for over 10 000 generations while reproducing either asexually or sexually. For 10 randomly chosen organisms from each population, we constructed and analysed all possible single mutants as well as one million mutants at each mutational distance from 2 to 10. The genomes of sexual organisms were more modular than asexual ones; sites encoding different functional traits had less overlap and sites encoding a particular trait were more tightly clustered. Net directional epistasis was alleviating (antagonistic) in both groups, although the overall strength of this epistasis was weaker in sexual than in asexual organisms. Our results show that sexual reproduction profoundly influences the evolution of the genetic architecture.},

We propose a suite of diagnostic analysis techniques that operate on lineages and phylogenies in digital evolution experiments, with the aim of improving our capacity to quantitatively explore the nuances of evolutionary histories in digital evolution experiments. We present three types of lineage measurements: lineage length, mutation accumulation, and phenotypic volatility. Additionally, we suggest the adoption of four phylogeny measurements from biology: phylogenetic richness, phylogenetic divergence, phylogenetic regularity, and depth of the most-recent common ancestor. In addition to quantitative metrics, we also discuss several existing data visualizations that are useful for understanding lineages and phylogenies: state sequence visualizations, fitness landscape overlays, phylogenetic trees, and Muller plots. We examine the behavior of these metrics (with the aid of data visualizations) in two well-studied computational contexts: (1) a set of two-dimensional, real-valued optimization problems under a range of mutation rates and selection strengths, and (2) a set of qualitatively different environments in the Avida digital evolution platform. These results confirm our intuition about how these metrics respond to various evolutionary conditions and indicate their broad value.},

The specific metrics used (novelty, complexity, diversity, etc) vary by researcher, but the holy grail would be a system where any of these can accumulate indefinitely. Of course, one challenge that we face in reaching this goal is even recognizing if we have succeeded. To determine the evolutionary potential of a system, we must conduct finite experiments; based on their results we can predict how we would expect evolution to progress were it to continue. Here we examine how such predictions might be made and how accurate they might be. We focus on predicting fitness; this metric is often easy to calculate, and correlated with increases in traits like novelty and complexity. For each run in a simple digital evolution experiment, we find the best fit to measured values of fitness, and demonstrate that projecting this fit out usually predicts that fitness will be constrained by an asymptote. Upon extending the experiment, however, we see that fitness often far exceeds this asymptote, belying the boundedness that it implies. Extending past a premature end point allows us to see beyond this "boundedness illusion"},

            Traits that are unused in a given environment are subject to processes that tend to erode them, leading to reduced fitness in other environments. Although this general tendency is clear, we know much less about why some traits are lost while others are retained, and about the roles of mutation and selection in generating different responses. We addressed these issues by examining populations of a facultative anaerobe,
            Escherichia coli
            , that have evolved for {\textgreater}30 years in the presence of oxygen, with relaxed selection for anaerobic growth and the associated metabolic plasticity. We asked whether evolution led to the loss, improvement, or maintenance of anaerobic growth, and we analyzed gene expression and mutational datasets to understand the outcomes. We identified genomic signatures of both positive and purifying selection on aerobic-specific genes, while anaerobic-specific genes showed clear evidence of relaxed selection. We also found parallel evolution at two interacting loci that regulate anaerobic growth. We competed the ancestor and evolved clones from each population in an anoxic environment, and we found that anaerobic fitness had not decayed, despite relaxed selection. In summary, relaxed section does not necessarily reduce an organism’s fitness in other environments. Instead, the genetic architecture of the traits under relaxed selection and their correlations with traits under positive and purifying selection may sometimes determine evolutionary outcomes.},

It uses new concepts and specific examples to show how to relate environmentally sensitive development to the genetic theory of adaptive evolution and to explain major patterns of change.

For more similar environments, adaptation is slower while history is more prominent. For both similar and dissimilar transfer environments, populations quickly lose the ability to perform computations (the analogue of beneficial chemical reactions) that are no longer rewarded in the new environment.

	abstract = {Evolutionary theory explains the origin of complex organismal features through a combination of reusing and extending information from less-complex traits, and by needing to exploit only one of many unlikely pathways to a viable solution. While the appearance of a new trait may seem sudden, we show that the underlying information associated with each trait evolves gradually. We study this process using digital organisms, self-replicating computer programs that mutate and evolve novel traits, including complex logic operations. When a new complex trait first appears, its proper function immediately requires the coordinated operation of many genomic positions. As the information associated with a trait increases, the probability of its simultaneous introduction drops exponentially, so it is nearly impossible for a significantly complex trait to appear without reusing existing information. We show that the total information stored in the genome increases only marginally when a trait first appears. Furthermore, most of the information associated with a new trait is either correlated with existing traits or co-opted from traits that were lost in conjunction with the appearance of the new trait. Thus, while total genomic information increases incrementally, traits that require much more information can still arise during the evolutionary process.},

              Escherichia coli
              to accumulate variation in populations of yellow fluorescent proteins and then evolved these proteins toward the new phenotype of green fluorescence. Populations with cryptic variation evolved adaptive genotypes with greater diversity and higher fitness than populations without cryptic variation, which converged on similar genotypes. Populations with cryptic variation accumulated neutral or deleterious mutations that break the constraints on the order in which adaptive mutations arise. In doing so, cryptic variation opens paths to adaptive genotypes, creates historical contingency, and reduces the predictability of evolution by allowing different replicate populations to climb different adaptive peaks and explore otherwise-inaccessible regions of an adaptive landscape.},

	abstract = {Natural populations often experience the weakening or removal of a source of selection that had been important in the maintenance of one or more traits. Here we refer to these situations as ‘relaxed selection,’ and review recent studies that explore the effects of such changes on traits in their ecological contexts. In a few systems, such as the loss of armor in stickleback, the genetic, developmental and ecological bases of trait evolution are being discovered. These results yield insights into whether and how fast a trait is reduced or lost under relaxed selection. We provide a prospectus and a framework for understanding relaxed selection and trait loss in natural populations. We also examine its implications for applied issues, such as antibiotic resistance and the success of invasive species.},
