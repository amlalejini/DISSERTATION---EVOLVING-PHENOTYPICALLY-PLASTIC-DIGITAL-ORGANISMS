A dissertation by Alexander M. Lalejini.

All of my requested (formatting) revisions from the graduate school are in the [supporting directory](https://github.com/amlalejini/DISSERTATION---EVOLVING-PHENOTYPICALLY-PLASTIC-DIGITAL-ORGANISMS/tree/main/supporting).

## Tips

- Standardize your latex labels and references. E.g., `chapter:[chapter-name]:sec:introduction`
- Silo chapters to avoid becoming overwhelmed with the size of your dissertation while you edit.   
- GitHub is fantastic for versioning!
