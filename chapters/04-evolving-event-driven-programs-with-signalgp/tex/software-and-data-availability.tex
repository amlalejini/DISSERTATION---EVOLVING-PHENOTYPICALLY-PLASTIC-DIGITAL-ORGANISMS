\section{Software and Data Availability}

We implemented SignalGP, the changing environment problem, and the distributed leader election problem using the Empirical scientific software library \citep{charles_ofria_2020_empirical}. 
We conducted all statistical analyses for this work using R version 3.3.2 \citep{r_core_team_2016}.
Our source code for test problems, experiment data, and analyses can be found in supplemental material \citep{signalgp_supplement_2018}, which is hosted on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/amlalejini/GECCO-2018-Evolving-Event-driven-Programs-with-SignalGP/}.
