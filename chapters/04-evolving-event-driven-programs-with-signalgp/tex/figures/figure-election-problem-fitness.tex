  Distributed leader election problem results. 
  The raincloud plots indicate the fitnesses of best performing distributed systems from each replicate. 
  The time series gives average fitness over time during evolution. 
  The colors in the time series correspond to the colors in the raincloud plots. 
  The shading on fitness trajectories in the time series indicates a bootstrapped 95\% confidence interval.
