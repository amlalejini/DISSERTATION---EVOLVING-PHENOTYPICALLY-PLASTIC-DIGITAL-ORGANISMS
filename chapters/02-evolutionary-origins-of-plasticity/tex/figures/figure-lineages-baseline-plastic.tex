  Time-sliced lineage visualization of dominant, plastic genotypes from the baseline treatment. 
  Abbreviated color reference: 
  cyan represents unconditional NOT task performance, 
  dark blue represents unconditional NAND task performance, 
  light purple represents sub-optimal forms of plasticity, 
  and dark purple represents optimal plasticity.  
  Refer to Figure \ref{chapter:origins-of-plasticity:fig:task-profiles} for a full legend of phenotype colors.}
