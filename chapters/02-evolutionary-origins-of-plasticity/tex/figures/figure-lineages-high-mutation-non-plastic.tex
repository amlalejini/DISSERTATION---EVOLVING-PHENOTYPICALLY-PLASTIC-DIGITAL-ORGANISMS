  \textbf{Time-sliced visualization of lineages for non-plastic, dominant genotypes from the high-mutation-rate treatment.}
  Abbreviated color reference: 
  cyan represents unconditional NOT task performance, 
  dark blue represents unconditional NAND task performance, 
  and light purple represents sub-optimal forms of plasticity.  
  Refer to Figure \ref{chapter:origins-of-plasticity:fig:task-profiles} for a full legend of phenotype colors.}
