    \textbf{Bitwise Boolean logic operations used in the Boolean-logic calculator problem.} 
    Programs are given a \code{nand} instruction and must construct each of the other operations (aside from ECHO) out of \code{nand} operations.
    As such, we measure the difficulty of each operation as the minimum number of NAND gates required to construct the given operation.
