\textbf{Contextual-signal problem-solving performance.}
(a) shows the number of successful replicates for the regulation-off and regulation-on conditions on the contextual-signal problem. 
The regulation-off condition was less successful than the regulation-on condition (Fisher's exact test: $p < 6\times10^{-9}$).
(b) is a raincloud plot showing the generation at which the first solution evolved in each successful replicate.
Gray points indicate the number of unsuccessful replicates for each condition.
Regulation-on solutions typically required fewer generations than regulation-off solutions to arise  (Wilcoxon rank sum test: $p < 10^{-15}$).
