    \textbf{The number of evolved solutions that generalize on the independent-signal problem.}
    The difference in number of solutions that generalize between the regulation-on and regulation-off conditions is statistically significant (Fisher's exact test: $p < 6\times10^{-06}$).
    The ``Regulation-ON (reg. KO)'' condition comprises the solutions from the Regulation-on condition, except with regulatory instructions knocked out (\textit{i.e.}, replaced with no-operation instructions).
