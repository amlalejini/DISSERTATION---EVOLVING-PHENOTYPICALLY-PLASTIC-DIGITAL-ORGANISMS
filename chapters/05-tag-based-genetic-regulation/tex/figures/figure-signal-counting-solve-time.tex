    \textbf{Generation at which first solution evolved (log scale) in each successful replicate for the signal-counting problem (raincloud plot \citep{allen_raincloud_2019}).}
    We show data from only those problem difficulties in which solutions evolved (two- and four-signal problems).
    Gray points indicate the number of unsuccessful replicates for each condition.
    For both problem difficulties, regulation-on solutions typically required fewer generations than regulation-off solutions to arise (Wilcoxon rank sum test; two-signal: $p < 10^{-15}$, four-signal: $p < 9\times10^{-05}$).
