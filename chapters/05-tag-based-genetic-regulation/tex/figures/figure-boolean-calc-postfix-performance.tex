\textbf{Boolean-logic calculator (postfix notation)  problem-solving performance.}
(a) shows the number of successful replicates for the regulation-off and regulation-on conditions on the postfix Boolean-logic calculator problem. 
The regulation-on condition was less successful than the regulation-off condition (Fisher's exact test: $p<0.002$).
(b) is a Raincloud plot showing the generation at which the first solution evolved in each successful replicate.
Gray points indicate the unsuccessful replicates for each condition.
Regulation-off solutions typically required fewer generations than regulation-on solutions to arise (Wilcoxon rank sum test: $p<0.004$).
