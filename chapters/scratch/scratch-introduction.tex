Many traditional linear genetic programming representations.

My work with self-replicating computer programs in Avida allowed me to build intuition for how mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity are implemented 

new model digital organisms capable of more complex forms of phenotypic plasticity
and new techniques for representing computer programs in genetic programming

My work studying phenotypic plasticity revealed shortcomings in the way that phenotypic plasticity is typically encoded in linear programs 

linear genetic programs 

Work with plasticity Avida revealed shortcomings of way that traditional digital organisms (and traditional linear programs in gp) are represented. 
In Avida, plasticity...
