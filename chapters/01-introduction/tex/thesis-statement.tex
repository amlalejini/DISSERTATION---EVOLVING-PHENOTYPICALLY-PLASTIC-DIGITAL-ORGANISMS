\section{Thesis Statement}

Plasticity important.
Plasticity useful.

% Plasticity is critical for organisms needing to respond to complex and ever changing environments as well as for computer programs that need to respond to complex and ever changing environments.
% Exploring the ramifications of plasticity: how does it effect subsequent dynamics and if we can have modularized responsiveness that allow useful applied goals/allow us to solve problems that would otherwise be challenging?

% Perspective I'm taking in this dissertation
% plasticity critical component for dynamic adaptiv systems, need to understand how it evolve, effects and how to best harness it applied systems.
