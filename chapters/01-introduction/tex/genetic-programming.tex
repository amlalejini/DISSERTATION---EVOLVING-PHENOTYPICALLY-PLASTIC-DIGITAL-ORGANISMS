\section{Genetic programming}

% Independent origins and different approaches
% - Tied together by the fact that we're using Darwinian dynamics to generate programs.

% Digital evolution has its roots in Genetic  Programming(GP), wherein computer programs are evolved using naturalprinciples. 
% For example, Avida (Ofria et al., 2009) is a pop-ular digital evolution system that uses self-replicating lineargenetic programs as its organisms. The organisms generallyfollow an imperative programming paradigm where computation is driven procedurally. 
% Program execution starts at thetop of the program and proceeds in sequence,  instruction-by-instruction, jumping or branching as dictated by executedinstructions (McDermott and Oâ€™Reilly, 2015)
