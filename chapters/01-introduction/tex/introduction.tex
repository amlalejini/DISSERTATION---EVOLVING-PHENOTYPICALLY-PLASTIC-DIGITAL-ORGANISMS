% @AML: comp exp evo => 'digital evolution'?
[This/my] dissertation straddles two [disciplines/methodologies] that have divergent goals but are unified by our ability to implement, observe, and exploit the constructive process of evolution [\textit{in silico}/in a computer/etc]: [\textit{in silico}/computational] experimental evolution and evolutionary computation.
Experimental evolution is the study of evolutionary change that occurs in experimental populations in response to conditions imposed by the experimenter [cite - Kawecki].
Experimental evolution allows us to test general hypotheses about evolutionary processes. 
Conventionally, such evolution experiments are performed under laboratory conditions using populations of biological organisms (e.g., e coli, pseudomanas, yeast, Drosophila, and phage-bacteria systems). 
[Famous examples, LTEE, experimental evolution of multicellularity, ...].
% @aml: keep comp exps general vs. narrowing immediately on self-replicating computer programs
[In silico] evolution experiments are performed using populations of \textit{digital} organisms---self-replicating computer programs---that compete, mutate, and evolve in computational environments. 
% In my ..., test hypotheses about the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.

% -- Evolutionary computation & Genetic programming --
Evolutionary computation exploits evolution as a general purpose search algorithm to solve challenging computational problems.
Such evolutionary algorithms begin with an initial population of individuals, be they potential solutions, computer programs, or robot body plans [citations]. 
Each generation, individuals are evaluated on one or more criteria and selected to contribute genetic material to the next generation.
% @AML: a little awkward
Evolutionary algorithms [steer/direct] populations through a problem's search space (i.e., the space of all possible [solutions/?]) by repeatedly replicating and varying (typically through mutation and crossover) promising individuals, replacing lower quality individuals in the population.
% In this way, the populations explore [conceptual figure?]... 
In my evolutionary computing dissertation work, I focus on \textit{genetic programming} wherein we evolve computer programs rather than writing them by hand.

% -- Synergy between disciplines --
Synergistic.
% introduce term 'biological complexity' maybe also diversity?
Deeper understanding of evolutionary processes that generated biological complexity observed on Earth/in nature improve existing and inspire new evolutionary algorithms, helping us solve increasingly challenging problems.
Advances in evolutionary computing can improve our ability to model evolutionary processes in silico, providing new ways to represent digital organisms, new analyses and visualizations. 

% @AML: need a smoother way to transition into defining/explaining/motivating plasiticity
% -- what is phenotypic plasticity & some biological motivation --
In my first [two] chapters, I used digital evolution to investigate the evolutionary origins and consequences of phenotypic plasticity.
Phenotypic plasticity is the capacity for a single genotype to express different phenotypes in response to a change in its environment [cite - west-eberhard].
Phenotypic plasticity underlies many complex traits and developmental patterns found in nature and serves as a key mechanism for responding to spatially and temporally variable environments [citations - Bradshaw, 1965].
For example, [ famous example? ].
Genetically homogeneous cells in a developing multicellular organism leverage their capacity for phenotypic plasticity to coordinate their expression patterns through environmental signals [Schlichting, 2003].
% @AML: don't love this next sentence
% Thus, understanding how phenotypic plasticity evolves and how it influences subseqent evolutionary outcomes is an important step toward a deeper understanding of [biological complexity].
[Indeed, biologists have long been interested in understanding how adaptive phenotypic plasticity evolves and how the evolution of plasticity influences subsequent evolutionary outcomes] [citations].
