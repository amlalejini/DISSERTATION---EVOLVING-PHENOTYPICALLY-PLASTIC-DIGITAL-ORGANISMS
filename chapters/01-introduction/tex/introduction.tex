[This/my] dissertation straddles two [disciplines/methodologies] that have divergent goals but are unified by our ability to implement, observe, and exploit the constructive process of evolution [\textit{in silico}/in a computer/etc]: [\textit{in silico}/computational] experimental evolution and evolutionary computation.
Experimental evolution is the study of evolutionary change that occurs in experimental populations in response to conditions imposed by the experimenter [cite - Kawecki].
Goal of experimental evolution is to test general hypotheses about evolutionary processes. 
Conventionally, such evolution experiments are performed under laboratory conditions using populations of biological organisms (e.g., e coli, pseudomanas, yeast, Drosophila, and phage-bacteria systems). 
[Famous examples, LTEE, experimental evolution of multicellularity, ...].
% @aml: keep comp exps general vs. narrowing immediately on self-replicating computer programs
[In silico] evolution experiments are performed using populations of \textit{digital} organisms---self-replicating computer programs---that compete, mutate, and evolve in computational environments.

% - Start with what phenotypic plasticity is -
% Phenotypic plasticity is [...].

Phenotypic plasticity is the capacity for a single genotype to express different phenotypes in response to a change in its environment [cite - west-eberhard].


% - [biological motivation]




% Focus:
% (1) Empirically studying the evolutionary origins and consequences of phenotypic plasticity.
% (2) Developing novel techniques for evolving computer programs, moving closer to capacity for complex plasticity we observe in nature.




% EC and DE unified by our ability to implement, observe, and exploit the constructive process of evolution \textit{in silico}.
